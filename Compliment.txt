Dear senior, 
As you are stepping out of this temple of knowledge, I see our little time flashback together. How much have you taught me in even the most mundabe of events! It has been amazing. 
Especially, these two years. What a light you are! I know the importance they hold in one's life, and having seen you live through your 'two major years' ,and as I see your pallette paint rainbows in these wordly skies, I know my plans just about right. Keep guiding me like this, ALWAYS. 
Seeking your love and guidance,
I wish you luck for your future endeavours. 
Succeed with flying colours and let your undying spirit conquer this world. Thank you!

Au Revoir.
